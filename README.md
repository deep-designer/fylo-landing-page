# Frontend Mentor - Fylo landing page with two column layout

My task was to build a Design for the Fylo landing page with two column layout challenge. (./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 
This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
